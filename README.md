# go_path_manager

This is a port of Charley Hutchison's <a href="https://github.com/glenwayguy/path_manager">path_manager</a> tool to Go.

## Why?

1) Ruby hates me. I can never get it to install, and I don't want to deal with the ensuing bullcrap.

2) Go requires none of that, and is a much simpler model for command line tools in particular

3) I thought it would be fun to get a bit of Ruby knowledge

## TODO
- Get rid of the goto if possible
- implement commands

## Note
This code is not even close to the best it could be. There is a bloody **goto** in there, for crying out loud.
