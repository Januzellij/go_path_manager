# go_path_manager

This is a port of Charley Hutchison's <a href="https://github.com/glenwayguy/path_manager">path_manager</a> tool to Go.

## Why?

1) Ruby hates me. I can never get it to install, and I don't want to deal with the ensuing bullcrap.

2) Go requires none of that, and is much simpler for command line tools in particular

3) I thought it would be fun to get a bit of Ruby knowledge
